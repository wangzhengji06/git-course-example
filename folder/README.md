# Example Git Repository

We are learning how to make commits.

We are about to make a commit without best practice.

- create the repo locally: local repository -> 'remote' repository (`git add remote <name> <URL>`)
- create the repo remotely: `git clone <URL>` 
- create a branch locally: `git checkout <branch>; git checkout -b <new branch>; git add ...; git commit -m ""` After several state and commits, `git push -u origin <new branch>` 
- create a new branch remotely: Just use Github UI `git fetch --all` `git checkout <branch>` This will allow git to create a counterpart locally.
